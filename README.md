Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

Objective: Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images

Procedure :- Encrypt images using pixel manipulation using a sequence of 3 integers as the encryption key. Decrypt encrypted images with the correct key or password. Menu-based interface for ease of use. Recursive design for seamless navigation. Handles both single-key and multiple-key encryption for added security. Provides flexibility with user input for image path and encryption key.
